# Business Intelligence in the Gaming Industry: Insights on Release Timing, Platforms, and Genres
### Business Intelligence Exam for EK 4th Semester (Dat1F24)

## Context
More and more games are being developed and not all of them are successful. Companies have access to a lot of data, which includes, to name a few: Where games are being sold, release date, genres and how many were sold. The dataset that this project will be working with contains data stretching back from 1971 (CHECK THIS DATE!!!) to 2024. NÃ†VN AT DER ER MEGET MANGLEFULD DATA OG ANDRE TING VED DET

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help companies that either develop, market and or publish games to increase their sales by looking at previously released games.

## Research Questions
In this project we will investigate the following questions:

1) When should a company release a game to maximize sales at launch?
- secoundar: which genre? ML: Linear / multiple linear regession. dependent variable: sales, independent variable: month or periode

2) Which consoles should a spefict genre game be developed for?
- ML: classficastion dependent variable: sales, independent variable: genre, console

3) How can trends be predicted so that a game is released when its genre is popular? how long intervals before genre is "hot"

4) Which game genres sell better in which regions, so that companies know where to market their games? which games for which regions
- ML: classficastion dependent variable: sales, independent variable: genre, region_sales

## Hypothesis
Our hypothesis for the above mentioned questions:

1) We assume that games sell better during certain periods of the year compared to others. Therefore, we expect to observe a trend where games released in those periods achieve higher sales.
2) We assume that certain game genres sell better on specific consoles. Therefore, we expect to see a significantly larger number of sales from a specific genre on those consoles.
3) We assume that some game genres follow a popularity cycle, and we expect to identify patterns in when specific genres become popular.
4) We assume that some game genres sell better in specific regions.

## Annotation
- This project addresses when it is most optimal to release a game in a specific genre and region.
- The success of a game is highly influenced by releasing it to the right target audience at the right time.
- Our project will be able to predict trends in the gaming market using a machine learning model.
- It will help companies avoid developing games that flop by essentially connecting the right game with the right user at the right time.
